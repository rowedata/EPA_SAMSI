\section{Introduction}

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

In 2016, the US EPA estimated that approximately 123 million people lived in 
counties where air quality concentrations were above the primary EPA's NAAQS \cite{EPAAir}. Additionally, the World Health Organization (in 2018) also reported an estimate of about 7 million premature deaths caused by ambient air pollution within the same timeline \cite{WhoAir}.
Research has provided linkage between exposure to Particulate Matter (PM) to diverse health related problems \cite{schwartz1996air, braga2001lag, dominici2006fine}. Information on the concentration levels for pollutants comes from two sources, which include monitoring sites (AQS) and output from complex numerical models that produce concentration surfaces over large spatial regions.\\
\vspace{-1em}
\begin{flushleft}
The EPA obtains the following data products from these information sources:
\begin{itemize}
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\item Air Quality System (AQS) measurements: Measurements of air pollutant concentrations from a monitoring network throughout the United States.
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\item Community Multi-scale Air Quality (CMAQ) model: Simulations that combine current knowledge in atmospheric science and air quality modeling and multi-processor computing techniques to produce pollutant estimates.
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\item Downscaler Model (DS): Model which fuses CMAQ output with air pollution readings using a spatially weighted model that regresses a monitoring data on a CMAQ derived regressor.
	\vspace{-0.5em}
	\item Inter-agency Monitoring of Protected Visual Environments (IMPROVE): Multi-agency monitor network to collect visibility related data.
\end{itemize}

\end{flushleft}
\begin{flushleft}
In recent decades, the attempt to fuse the two sources of information has allowed the EPA to provide downscaler Air Quality surfaces on a national spatial scale \cite{berrocal2010bivariate, berrocal2010spatio}. However, predictions on a regional scale produce an unsmoothed national surface.\\~

With this study, we intend to build a methodological splicing framework/algorithm for regional estimates along regional boundaries to create smooth national surface.
